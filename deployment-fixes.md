# Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **ESLint Configuration Error**
   - Problem: `ESLint configuration in .eslintrc.json Â» plugin:security/recommended is invalid: - Unexpected top-level property "name"`
   - Solution: Simplified the ESLint configuration by removing the security plugin configuration that was causing issues.

2. **Missing Dependency**
   - Problem: `Module not found: Can't resolve 'micro'` in webhook.js
   - Solution: Added the `micro` package as a dependency with `npm install micro --save`

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure:

1. All dependencies are properly installed and listed in package.json
2. The Node.js version is set to 18.x in package.json (which it already is)
3. ESLint configuration is valid
4. All environment variables are properly set in Vercel

## Environment Variables

Make sure the following environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- `PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required for webhook.js)

## Base64 Image Storage

We've also implemented a solution to avoid CORS issues with Firebase Storage:

1. Images are now converted to Base64 and stored directly in Firestore
2. This eliminates CORS issues when loading images
3. Size limits are in place to prevent exceeding Firestore document size limits
4. Both the carousel manager and display components have been updated to work with Base64 images

## Next Steps

After deploying, monitor the application for any issues and check the Vercel build logs to ensure everything is working correctly.
