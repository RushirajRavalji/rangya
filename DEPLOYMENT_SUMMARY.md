# Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to make the Rangya e-commerce platform ready for deployment.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Firebase Admin SDK Client-Side Issues

- Updated `utils/firebase-admin.js` to use CommonJS imports and provide a dummy implementation for client-side
- Added proper conditional checks to ensure Firebase Admin SDK is only used on the server side
- Created fallbacks for Node.js-specific modules in webpack configuration

### 2. Server-Side Data Fetching

- Updated `pages/admin/users/index.js` to use `getServerSideProps` for fetching users instead of client-side fetching
- Created a proper API endpoint for user deletion at `pages/api/admin/users/delete.js`
- Added proper error handling for server-side operations

### 3. Build Configuration

- Updated `next.config.js` to exclude test pages from the build
- Added polyfills for Node.js modules in webpack configuration
- Configured proper fallbacks for Node.js-specific modules

### 4. Deployment Tools

- Created a comprehensive deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Added a `prepare-deploy` script to check if the project is ready for deployment
- Created a `deploy` script to automate the deployment process
- Added environment variable validation to ensure all required variables are set

## Deployment Process

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run prepare-deploy` to check if the project is ready for deployment
3. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the application to Vercel

## Important Notes

- The application requires Firebase Admin SDK credentials to be set in environment variables
- Test pages are excluded from the build to avoid issues with Firebase Admin SDK
- The application is configured to use Vercel for deployment
- The application requires Node.js 18.x or higher

## Next Steps

- Set up a custom domain in Vercel
- Configure Firebase security rules for production
- Set up regular database backups
- Configure monitoring and analytics
